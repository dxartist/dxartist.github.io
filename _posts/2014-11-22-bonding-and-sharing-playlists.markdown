Music is powerful thing. I think a person's taste in music is a reflection of their inner being; A deeper look into the nature of a person. I love music, I love talking about music. Lightbulb! - I want to build an application to link people through music interests. 

I did a simple google search to see whats out there. There are many 'playlist' sharing applications available. I want to believe mine will be different (not interesting in doing extensive research into current competition). My main aim is to learn, if this turns out to be awesome - well, then awesome!

App concept

+ to share playlists with peers
+ to get information about music (producer, album art etc)
+ to link people together & strengthen bonds
+ to provide download information for music

I am calling this project 'lala' &mdash; means music in Ga.
