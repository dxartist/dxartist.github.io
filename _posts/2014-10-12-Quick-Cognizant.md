Hi, I'm an employee in Cognizant Technology Solutions. Recently I was searching for a Cognizant app on playstore. Luckily I did find one but of no use to a common associate. So I thought of creating an app for cognizant myself with the following conditions.

1. It should serve the purpose.

2. It should be a free app and free from ads (non-profit).

3. It should help cognizant employees (the sole purpose).


![_config.yml](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xDsrSaQPZaLDWCQMJi6QhxzWtBtfAfX66pjM3oh_7SI=w624-h305-no)

You can download the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dt.sharath.quickcognizant).
I decided that the logo should have a 'C' with the same font as in Cognizant logo just to relate with the company. The app is not complete and needs a lot of improvements. I'm finding it hard to improve the app along with my work schedule and other activities I have. I'm looking for developers who can take up the task of improving this app. This can be an opportunity to work for a community.

## How you can help me? ##

1. There should be one time login (user doesn't have to enter the password for the next login).

2. There should be a loading page ( there will be a white background while the page is loading. This could be annoying to users. There should be a progress bar of some kind).

3. Back button directly exits the user from the app ( navigation should be sorted out)

Those who want to help me with this, please contact me by clicking on the icon on the footer.
