I created these icons for an android app I was working on.

>First thing is that the icons are pentagonal shape.


>They have flat UI color background.


>They all have a long shadow.

I'll write a tutorial soon on how to do it in Photoshop so that you can create your own set of icons in any shape and color you want.

Thanks for reading!
